### Optional OpenAIRE OAI-PMH Custom Set Definition

Optionally, a repository may wish to define a specific OAI "custom set" for OpenAIRE to harvest from.  For example, if you only want a portion of the item_types to be harvested, and/or you want to limit the harvesting to unembargoed items, you would define a custom set using something like this:

```
$oai->{custom_sets} = [
	{ 	spec => "openaire", name => "OpenAIRE Set - OA article conference book monograph",
		filters=> [
			{meta_fields=>["full_text_status"], value=>"public"},
			{meta_fields =>[qw( type )], merge => "ANY", value => "article conference_item book_section monograph book" }
		]
	}	
];
```

Normally, there should be an `oai.pl` file here: `/archives/[REPOID]/cfg/cfg.d/`
This is where other oai-pmh configuration settings are, so this is where you would add this to create a custom set for OpenAIRE.
